> **Note:** This is a work in progress and still needs some tweaking and more components to be a complete framework. I am adding more components as I need them. 

## Lion Responsive Framework

Lion is a front went framework that is very opinionated. I designed it to be a boilerplate framework to quickly get a design up without needing to use too much custom markup. The idea is to be very basic and semantic with the markup so that it can be customized later.

## Gulp Commands

    gulp

the default gulp command runs the css and js functions. This compiles and minifies thee source files.

    gulp watch

The watch command runs the same css and js functions but also watches the files while you conitinue to work on them. 

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lion](http://juliansalas.com/lion/docs).
